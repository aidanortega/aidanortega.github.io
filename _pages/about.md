I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Sciences focusing in Neuroscience and Neurobiology with expertise in electrophysiology, computational neuroscience and data analysis. 

My research focuses on **neural network dynamics** using techniques such as **patch clamp**, **calcium imaging** and **multi-electrode array (MEA)** recordings to study brain activity and machine learning to perform the analyses. I have developed custom Python scripts for automated processing and analyzing experimental datasets, including spike detection and characterization, spike clustering and spectral analysis of neural data.

Beyond research, I teach at the <a href='https://www.ingenieria.unam.mx/'>Facultad de Ingeniería</a>, offering courses in Mechanical Drawing, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM). My classes blend computational simulations with hands-on prototyping, emphasizing design methodology and manufacturing processes.

I am passionate about open science and interdisciplinary research, bridging the gap between neuroscience and engineering.

Outside academia, I enjoy exploring AI applications (not only in engineering) and mentoring students in scientific and engineering research projects.
